# SysMLv2LibrarySTPA

The development of complex transport systems presents significant safety challenges. While safety-driven and model-based approaches show promise, their adoption is still in its early stages. One hazard analysis method that is gaining traction is the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Integrating STPA with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) holds great potential, thanks to their shared system-theoretic foundation. Simultaneously, SysML v2, with extensibility features such as libraries, offers new integration opportunities. Accordingly, this repo proposes an open-source SysML v2 library for STPA.
